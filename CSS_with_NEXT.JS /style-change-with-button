           such as clicking a button, can be achieved through a combination of state management and CSS classes.
            To implement this, you typically start by defining
             a state variable to track the current style or a boolean state that toggles the style.
           For example, using React's useState hook:</p>
 
      <br />
      <button onClick={()=>setparagraph({background:"Red"})}>Update-style </button>
    </main>
  );
}
