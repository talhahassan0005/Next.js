Next.js
Next.js is a powerful React framework designed for building modern web applications. It combines the efficiency of server-side rendering with the flexibility of client-side rendering, providing developers with a robust toolkit to create fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web apps.

Key Features
Server-side Rendering (SSR): Achieve blazing-fast initial load times and improved SEO by rendering pages on the server before sending them to the client.

Client-side Rendering (CSR): Enhance user experience with dynamic content updates and interactive features handled on the client side.

Built-in API Routes: Easily create API endpoints within your Next.js application, simplifying backend development and integration.

Automatic Code Splitting: Optimize performance by automatically splitting code into smaller bundles, loading only what is necessary for each page.

Static Site Generation (SSG): Generate static HTML files at build time for pages with no server-side processing, ensuring quick deployment and efficient caching.

CSS and Sass Support: Enjoy built-in support for CSS modules and Sass, enabling modular and maintainable stylesheets.

TypeScript Support: Utilize TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer productivity.
